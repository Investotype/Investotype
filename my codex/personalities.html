      <h1>Personality Explanations</h1>
      <p class="sub">Each profile below explains behavior patterns, best-fit investments, and practical strengths and weaknesses so users can act with discipline rather than emotion.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="capital-preserver" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Capital Defender</h2>
      <p>You are an extreme capital defender. You would rather look boring in bull markets than be broken in bear markets.</p>
      <p>Your ideal build is a fortress: heavy Treasuries and high-grade bonds, plus a small sleeve of resilient defensive equities.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> excellent downside control, high behavioral discipline, and lower panic-selling risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> can underperform during strong growth rallies and may hold excess cash for too long.</p>
      <p>This style resembles investors like Warren Buffett in conservative periods, Howard Marks, and Benjamin Graham.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="income-defender" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Income Investor</h2>
      <p>You optimize for paycheck-like portfolio income. Stability of distributions matters more than chasing the hottest ticker.</p>
      <p>Your best tools are dividend quality, utilities, selective REITs, and bond ballast that keep cash flow alive across cycles.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> stable income orientation, lower volatility focus, and better patience in sideways markets.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> potential yield-chasing behavior and slower upside capture in innovation-led bull phases.</p>
      <p>Comparable styles appear in income-first portfolio managers and conservative Buffett-style dividend allocators.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="balanced-builder" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Balanced Growth Investor</h2>
      <p>You are growth-oriented but controlled. You take calculated shots instead of swinging at every hype cycle.</p>
      <p>Your edge comes from disciplined rebalancing, quality selection, and refusing to abandon risk controls when markets get loud.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> broad diversification, steadier compounding across cycles, and lower dependence on one market narrative.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> may feel too conservative in momentum surges and can drift without consistent rebalancing.</p>
      <p>This approach aligns with diversified allocators such as Ray Dalio and David Swensen-style portfolio construction.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="core-indexer" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Index Investor</h2>
      <p>You trust systems over storytelling. You automate, rebalance, and compound while others overtrade their own emotions.</p>
      <p>Broad ETFs, scheduled contributions, and minimal friction are your core weapons for long-horizon wealth building.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> cost efficiency, consistency, and reduced behavioral mistakes over long horizons.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> limited tactical flexibility and possible hidden concentration when index leadership narrows.</p>
      <p>This mindset is closest to John Bogle followers, Buffett’s guidance for most investors, and Bill Gates-style long-horizon compounding.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="quality-grower" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Quality Growth Investor</h2>
      <p>You hunt elite businesses, not cheap narratives. You want pricing power, durable margins, and execution that survives competition.</p>
      <p>You favor compounders with real moats and avoid speculative names that cannot defend cash flow quality.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> strong upside capture with quality filtering and lower blow-up risk versus speculative growth.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> valuation risk if entry discipline slips and crowding risk in popular quality names.</p>
      <p>This style is similar to Peter Lynch, Philip Fisher, and Bill Gates in technology ecosystem focus.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tactical-analyzer" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Tactical Investor</h2>
      <p>You do not marry one market story. You rotate with evidence and reposition aggressively when regime signals shift.</p>
      <p>A strategic core plus a tactical sleeve lets you strike fast while retaining long-term market participation.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> regime adaptability, proactive risk control, and faster response to changing market structure.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> complexity risk, potential overfitting, and high turnover if rules are not strictly enforced.</p>
      <p>Comparable styles include Jim Simons systematic thinking, Cliff Asness factor discipline, and Ray Dalio macro frameworks.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="visionary-venture" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Innovation Investor</h2>
      <p>You chase asymmetric winners early. You accept volatility because one breakout thesis can change the entire return profile.</p>
      <p>You need a strict moonshot sleeve with hard caps, because conviction without sizing discipline is portfolio self-sabotage.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> strong potential to capture nonlinear winners early in major technology transitions.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> large drawdown risk, narrative bias, and patience fatigue during long underperformance windows.</p>
      <p>This profile resembles Cathie Wood, venture-style growth allocators, and Bill Gates in long-horizon transformation themes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="high-risk-rider" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Aggressive Investor</h2>
      <p>You move fast in violent markets and exploit momentum while others hesitate. Your strength is speed under pressure.</p>
      <p>Your weakness is overreach, so strict stop rules and hard position limits are mandatory for survival.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> rapid opportunity capture and high upside in momentum-driven phases.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> overtrading, leverage creep, and concentration risk without hard exposure limits.</p>
      <p>This approach resembles aggressive tactical traders and Soros-style conviction sizing when risk control is enforced.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="alternative-explorer" class="card persona-detail">
      <h2>Alternative Investor</h2>
      <p>You build multi-engine portfolios designed for non-consensus outcomes. You actively combine assets that do not move together.</p>
      <p>Your power is diversification by design, but complexity must stay thesis-driven or it becomes expensive noise.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> broader diversification and improved resilience when traditional assets struggle together.</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> complexity and fee drag risk, plus hidden exposures if alternatives are not actively monitored.</p>
      <p>This style is closest to Ray Dalio’s diversification mindset, Bill Gates multi-asset orientation, and alternative-focused institutional allocators.</p>
