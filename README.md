# Investotype

Static website for the Investotype investor-personality quiz and market news pages.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

This repo is configured to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Push this project to the `main` branch.
3. In the repository, open `Settings -> Pages`.
4. Set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.
5. Push changes to `main` any time you want to republish.

After the workflow finishes, your site will be available at:

- `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Local preview

Because this is a plain static site, you can preview by opening `index.html` directly, or with a local static server.
